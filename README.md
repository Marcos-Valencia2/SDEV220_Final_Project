# SDEV220_Final_Project

For this project there are two programs with a main function CoffeeShop.java and CoffeeShopJFrame.java

to use CoffeeShopJFrame you need to open the file and run it. it will show a frame and boxes that can be selected and deselected. As you choose the items you want the final price will change depending on what is selected. To exit the frame just press the x button.

To use CoffeeShop you will need the following files downloaded: Cold.java, cookies.java, Customer.java, Hot.java, menu.java, muffin.java, and Reciept.txt Once those files are downloaded the main function should be able to run however you may need to change the path in the CoffeeShop.java to an absolute path so that the file is able to reach and make changes to the Reciept.txt file. 

Run both programs in a VS code environment to ensure that they work.

The point of this program is to create a program that a user can use to order coffee from a shop. The program is able to keep track of the customer info incase the shop needs it and the customer is able to be shown the menu and is given a recipt to see what they ordered and the amount they payed.
